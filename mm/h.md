# h

## high_memory
the end bound of linearly mapped virtual address by the kernel

## max_low_pfn
in x86, specifies the number of memory pages present on the systems which could be mapped linearly into the kernel virtual memory space. In X86-32, this number is limited to the page frame number corresponding to 896mb and in X86-64, this is the page number corresponding to the maximum physical memory address.
